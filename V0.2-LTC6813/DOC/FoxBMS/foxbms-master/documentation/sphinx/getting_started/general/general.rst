=============================
Getting Started with |foxbms|
=============================

How to use this documentation
-----------------------------

The complete |foxbms| documentation is available and maintained in HTML, PDF
and EPUB formats.

.. note::

      A search function is available under the |foxbms| logo in the HTML
      version of the documentation.

How to Generate the HTML Documentation and Set up |foxbms| rapidly
------------------------------------------------------------------

First, the :ref:`getting_started_foxconda` part of the documentation explains
how to install and configure the |foxconda3| software used to compile the
embedded software and generate the HTML documentation. Then, the
:ref:`getting_started_build` part explains how to get and build the sources.
Finally, the :ref:`getting_started_eclipse_workspace` guide explains how to
setup an Eclipse workspace to browse the |foxBMS| sources conveniently, how to
supply the hardware with power and how to flash the |foxbms| firmware on
|MCU0| and |MCU1| located on the |BMS-Master| in the |master|.

If these steps are done, |foxbms| already runs. The last step is longer
because connectors must be made. In this last step, it is explained how to
prepare the other parts of the |foxbms| hardware.


Where Can the Layout and Schematic Files be Found?
